== Machine Learning Exchange (MLX) Project Proposal

*Name of the projects*: 

  - Machine Learning Exchange (MLX)

*Requested maturity level*: Sandbox

*Description*

We are open sourcing *Machine Learning Exchange (MLX)* , a Data and AI Assets Catalog and Execution Engine. It allows upload, register, execute, and deploy 

 - AI pipelines and Components
 - Models
 - Datasets
 - Notebooks

Additionally it provides: 

 - Automated sample pipeline code generation to execute egistered models, datasets and notebooks
 - Pipelines Engine powered by Kubeflow Pipelines on Tekton, core of Watson Pipelines
 - Serving engine by KFServing (Next gen base for WML)
 - Datasets Management by Datashim
 - Preregistered Datasets from Data Asset Exchange (DAX) and Models from Model Asset Exchange(MAX)
 - Model Metadata schema aligned with MLSpec

*Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects? Please explain*:

MLX already has integration hooks with LFAI Trusted AI projects, including Adversarial Robustness 360 (ART), AI Fairness 360 (AIF360), AI Explainability 360 (AIX360)
by creatiing Pipeline components for these. Additionally Datasets execution is powered by Datashim for downloads and PVC creation, which is also in LFAI and Data. 

We have also been exploring integration with Acumos projects, by identifying how to take models from Machine Learning Exchnage and moving them to Acumos Marketplace by using
Acumos SDK to generate compliant metadata.

*Release methodology & mechanics:*

  - https://github.com/machine-learning-exchange/mlx/releases


General Release Methodology:

  - Builds on the master branch (and pull requests to the master branch) are tested with Travis CI on our unit tests (Linux machine only).
  - Non-critical fixes/features are generally held until a critical feature/fix is added and then all new additions are compiled into a release at that time
  - Follow a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version numbering
  - The PATCH number is increased when fixes or small features are added
  - The MINOR number is increased when new algorithms or major (but backward-compatible) features are added
  - The MAJOR number is increased when major backward-incompatible changes are made
